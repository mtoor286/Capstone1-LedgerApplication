Capstone 1: Build an Accounting Ledger Application

Description of the project: 

The project itself is similar to a banking application 
that allows the user to add Deposits, make Payments and 
view entries of different transactions that have been 
made through a specific period of time. 

A specific piece of code that I would like to describe 
would the displayAllTransactions() part and the reason 
being for that is, this part of the code was really 
short, and I was not expecting it to work, but it did 
work. 

At first, I was a bit confused on how this part 
of the code would work, but the code for this part
turned out to be really simple and wasn't overwhelming
like any other code. I was able to troubleshoot and 
make the code work within an hour. 

Overall the capstone-1 was a roller coaster of emotions, 
and I am looking forward for the next capstone.

Thank You.
